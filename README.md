# Tweety
This Python script by COPYNINJA automates Twitter posts. It prompts for API credentials on launch, reads tweets from tweets.txt, and attaches random images from the pic folder. A menu lets users set time intervals between posts. Perfect for flexible, image-enhanced tweet scheduling across multiple accounts.
