# Tweety
This Python script by COPYNINJA automates Twitter posts. It prompts for API credentials on launch, reads tweets from tweets.txt, and attaches random images from the pic folder. A menu lets users set time intervals between posts. Perfect for flexible, image-enhanced tweet scheduling across multiple accounts.
To automate tweet posting on Twitter with Python, you can use the Tweepy library, which provides access to Twitter’s API. Here's how you can set it up:

Step 1: Set Up Twitter Developer Account

1. Go to the Twitter Developer Portal.


2. Create a Twitter Developer account and set up an app to get your API keys and tokens:

API Key and API Key Secret

Access Token and Access Token Secret




Step 2: Install Tweepy Library

You can install Tweepy via pip:

pip install tweepy
How It Works

Authentication: Uses your API keys and access tokens to authenticate.

Tweet Posting: api.update_status(content) posts a tweet with the given content.

Intervals: You can adjust the interval variable to control how frequently tweets are posted.


This script posts each tweet from the tweets list at the specified interval (e.g., every hour). Adjust the interval and tweet content as needed.

Important Notes

1. Rate Limits: Be aware of Twitter’s rate limits to avoid getting your account temporarily locked.


2. Errors Handling: Always handle errors gracefully (e.g., network issues or rate limits) with try and except.
